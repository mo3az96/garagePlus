        <p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>

        <p>
          CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
          websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach
          stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in
          the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites
          collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
          consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
          exactly the information being collected and those individuals or
          companies with whom it is being shared.
        </p>

          According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:<br />
          Users can visit our site anonymously.<br />
          Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our
          home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after
          entering our website.<br />
          Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be

        <p><strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong></p>

        <p>
          We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use
          advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.

          <strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party
          behavioral tracking.

        <p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p>

        <p>
          When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
          under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy
          Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade
          Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the
          COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
          services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br />
          We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years
          old.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p>

        <p>
          The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
          law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
          significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
          globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
          they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
          privacy laws that protect personal information.<br />
          In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take
          the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:<br />
          We will notify you via email<br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Within 7 business days
        </p>

        <p>
          We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that
          individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights
          against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
          This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable
          rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
          courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
          non-compliance by data processors.

        <p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></p>

        <p>
          The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,
          establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the
          right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out
          tough penalties for violations.<br />
          We collect your email address in order to:

        <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>

          emails, you can email us at<br />
          and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.
